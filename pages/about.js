              <br/>
              <p>
                We all have thoughts, beliefs, and something brewing deep inside us.
                They are very personal, original, and meaningful.
                However, we rarely share them with others, simply because it is weird to them bring up.
                Despite our technological advances, this is still a problem today.
                Knowing what others think about our thoughts helps us grow intellectually.
                Platonos is an experimental platform that aims to achieve that.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>
                Any talk is rewarding if participants are open-minded and thoughtful. 
                Any topic, without jargons, can be explained so that anyone could appreciate it.
                Everyone is worth talking with.
